    <p>BEYOND FEAR, DESTINY AWAITS.</p>
    <p>
      Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny
      beyond his understanding, must travel to the most dangerous planet in the
      universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent
      forces explode into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the
      most precious resource in existence-a commodity capable of unlocking
      humanity’s greatest potential-only those who can conquer their fear will
      survive.
